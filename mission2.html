            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Chess is a board game played by 2 players. Each player takes turns moving a piece of their colour
                (usually black or white), with the final objective of the game being to "Checkmate" the opposing player.
                Each player starts with a total of 16 pieces consisting of 6 different types. There are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>8 Pawns</li>
                <li>2 Rooks (Also known as Castles)</li>
                <li>2 Knights</li>
                <li>2 Bishops</li>
                <li>1 Queen</li>
                <li>1 King</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Board</h2>
            <p>The chessboard is an 8 x 8 grid of alternating black and white squares. The person playing 'White' will
                have their pieces arranged in the following order from left to right:</p>
            <p>Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King, Bishop, Knight, Rook</p>
            <p>The second row, will be lined up with 8 pawns. 'Black's Pieces should mirror the positions of the white
                pieces.</p>

                <p> Each player starts with 8 pawns. The pawn can only move one step forward, except for on it's
                first move when it has the option of moving 2 steps forward.
                However, When attacking, it can only attack pieces that are diagonally infront (either left or
                right),
                and cannot attack pieces directly infront of it.</p>

            <h2>Check, Checkmate & Stalemate</h2>
            <p>When the King is in a position such that it can be taken by the opponent in their next turn, it is
                said
                to be in <i>Check</i>.
                In this situation, the payer in <i>Check</i> must move their King out of danger, or place another
                piece
                to block the attack.</p>
            <p>When the King is in <i>Check</i> and there is no way to get the King out of <i>Check</i> (King cannot
                move
                into a space where it is not under attack, and there are no other pieces that can block the attack)
                , that is considered <i>Checkmate</i>, and that player loses.</p>
            <p>Stalemate is when the King is not in Check, and the player has no move where the King is not placed
                in
                check, the game is considered in a <i>Stalemate</i> and ends in a draw.</p>
